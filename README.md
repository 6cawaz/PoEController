##Goals

The main problem with using a gamepad in Path of Exile is that the game is in no way designed to be friendly to few key bindings. It heavily focuses use of the mouse cursor and several key bindings for optimal gameplay.

Many people provided solutions to play Path of Exile with a gamepad before. However, the main focus of this solution is to reduce the need of using a gamepad input as a mouse cursor to a minimum.
